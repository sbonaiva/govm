**Go Version Manager (govm)** is a command-line tool written in Go that simplifies the management of Go installations on your machine. 
With a few simple commands, you can easily list, install, and uninstall different versions of the Go programming language, making it perfect for developers who need to switch between versions for various projects.

## Features

- **List Installed Versions**: Quickly check all the Go versions available and currently installed on your system.
- **Install Specific Version**: Install a specific version of Go with a single command.
- **Uninstall Version**: Remove any installed version of Go when itâ€™s no longer needed.

## Installation

To get started with `govm`, you need to have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed on your machine. 

After that, you can download the `govm` binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/sbonaiva/govm/releases).

Alternatively, you can build it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbonaiva/govm.git
cd govm
make install
```

## Usage

### List Installed Versions

```bash
govm list
```

This command will display all Go versions currently installed on your system.

### Install a Specific Version

```bash
govm install [version]
```

Replace `[version]` with the desired Go version (e.g., `go1.17.6`). This command will download and install the specified version.

### Uninstall a Version

```bash
govm uninstall [version]
```

Replace `[version]` with the Go version you want to remove from your system.
